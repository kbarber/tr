  Might be better (possibly less flexible) to use
  http://search.cpan.org/~makamaka/JSON-RPC-0.95/lib/JSON/RPC.pm, though
  need to make sure it doesn't use filters?


Bit rough, but currently

Map path to modules:

/          : TR             { TR->json_action }
/ldap      : TR::ldap       { TR::ldap->json action }
/ldap/user : TR::ldap::user { TR::ldap::user->json_action }


TR::ldap inherets common stuff like config from TR.
TR::ldap::user inherits all ldap stuff from TR::ldap so common functions
for ldap live there.

Handler
  Doc support.
  Hand off, support CGI and mod_perl so app can be run stand alone.
  Make as similar to Catalyst as possible so we keep our future options
  open?
  People with exposure to catalyst will have less of a
  learning curve.
  Have module per content-type, probaby handle input and output by per
  content modules.

Think about:
  Auditing/Logging (easy to hook into _run_method)
  ACLs             (easy to hook into _run_method)
  Hooks?

TODO:
  Exception handling:
    Remove ugly "returns" needed for Test::More, more to exceptions and
    exception testing.
